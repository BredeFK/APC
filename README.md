# Scripts

## About

Here is my collection of scripts I find cool or usefully.
It's categorised by the folders.

### Spotify

Spotify-folder is (currently) for writing all tracks from a specified playlist
in to a file. There will be another README file in each category explaining further how it works.

### Organize_Folder

This folder is to get all song files in one folder, so you don't have to go in to each folder in a folder in a folder to
move them out. This will not delete the empty folders afterwards, only move the songs.

#### Example

File structure before: <br>

```
complete/userxD/another_folder/KJØPE HELE SVERIGE.flacc
complete/tempyBoi/01.02.2023 - DNB /hackers.mp3
complete/tempyBoi/12.12.2020 - Pop /baby.mp3
```

File structure after: <br>

```
songs/KJØPE HELE SVERIGE.flacc
songs/hackers.mp3
songs/baby.mp3
```

## Other

* The scripts are written using IntelliJ
* The scripts are running on Python version 3.10
