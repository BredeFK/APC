# Scripts

## About

Here is my collection of scripts I find cool or usefully.
It's categorised by the folders, so the folder `Spotify` is (currently) for writing all tracks from a specified playlist
in to a file. There will be another README file in each category explaining further how it works.

## Other

* The scripts are written using IntelliJ
* The scripts are running on Python version 3.10
