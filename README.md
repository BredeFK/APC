# Scripts

## About

Here is my collection of scripts I find cool or usefully.
It's categorised by the folders.

### Spotify

Spotify-folder is (currently) for writing all tracks from a specified playlist
in to a file. There will be another README file in each category explaining further how it works.

### Organize_Folder

This folder is to get all song files in one folder, so you don't have to go in to each folder in a folder in a folder to
move them out. This will not delete the empty folders afterwards, only move the songs.

## Other

* The scripts are written using IntelliJ
* The scripts are running on Python version 3.10
